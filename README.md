- TakeProfit: The calculated take profit level.
- TrailingStop: The calculated trailing stop level.

## Initialization

The **OnInit()** function is responsible for initializing the EA. It calculates the stop loss, take profit, and trailing stop levels based on market conditions. The calculated values are printed in the Journal for reference.

## Trading Algorithm

The **OnTick()** function is the main trading algorithm of the EA. It executes the trading logic for the USDCAD currency pair. The algorithm includes the following steps:

1. Check if the current instrument is USDCAD.
2. Place buy/sell orders with the specified order size, stop loss, and take profit.
3. Close positions at the appropriate time to secure profits and minimize drawdowns.
4. Implement trailing stop functionality to protect profits.

## Calculation Functions

The calculation functions are responsible for determining the stop loss, take profit, and trailing stop levels based on market conditions. These functions are called during initialization.

## Order Functions

The order functions implement the logic for opening, closing, and modifying positions. The **ConditionToOpenPosition()** function determines when to open a position, while the **ConditionToClosePosition()** function determines when to close a position. The **CloseAllPositions()** function closes all open positions, and the **ModifyStopLoss()** function modifies the stop loss based on the trailing stop level.
